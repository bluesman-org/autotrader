# User System Design Summary

## Requirements Satisfaction

The user system design satisfies the requirements specified in the issue description:

> Design user system and document it, do not implement it yet. a user can have 1 or more bots, maximum 100 bots.

### Key Points:

1. **User Model**: A comprehensive user model has been designed with all necessary attributes for authentication,
   identification, and profile management.

2. **Bot Ownership**: The design establishes a clear relationship between users and bots by adding a `userId` field to
   the `BotConfiguration` document.

3. **Bot Limit Enforcement**: The system enforces the maximum limit of 100 bots per user through validation in the
   `BotConfigurationService`.

4. **Documentation**: The design is thoroughly documented in the [user-system-design.md](user-system-design.md) file,
   including:
    - Data models
    - Service layer logic
    - API endpoints
    - Authentication and authorization
    - Database schema and indexes
    - Future enhancements

## Integration with Existing System

The user system is designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing Autotrader application:

1. **Minimal Changes**: The design requires minimal changes to existing code, primarily adding a `userId` field to the
   `BotConfiguration` class and updating the `BotConfigurationService` to enforce bot limits.

2. **Consistent Patterns**: The user model follows the same patterns as existing models, extending `BaseDocument` and
   using MongoDB annotations.

3. **Security Integration**: The authentication system is designed to work with Spring Security, which can be easily
   integrated with the existing Spring Boot application.

## Implementation Plan

While implementation is not part of the current scope, the design provides a clear roadmap for future implementation:

1. **Phase 1**: Create the User model and repository
2. **Phase 2**: Implement authentication with Spring Security and JWT
3. **Phase 3**: Update the BotConfiguration model and service to include user ownership
4. **Phase 4**: Implement API endpoints for user management
5. **Phase 5**: Add authorization checks to existing bot management endpoints

## Conclusion

The user system design provides a solid foundation for implementing user management in the Autotrader application. It
satisfies all the requirements specified in the issue description and is designed to integrate well with the existing
codebase.

The design is modular and extensible, allowing for future enhancements such as two-factor authentication, social login,
and user groups.
